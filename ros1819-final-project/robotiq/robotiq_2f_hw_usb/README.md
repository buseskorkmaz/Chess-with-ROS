# Robotiq 2F models hardware

This packages addresses the hardware abstraction as well as interfaces to real and simulated robotiq gripper of the 2-finger models.

This interfaces requires the modbus library, that you can easilly install by typing:

`sudo apt-get install libmodbus-dev`

## Using the USB communication interface

This is perhaps the simplest way to connect to the real gripper, since the R485/USB adaptor comes by default because it is required to config the gripper using the User Interface.

In order to run this interface, you need to follow this steps.

* Connect and power the gripper
* Check with `lsusb` that it connected. You should see something like:

`Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0403:6015 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd Bridge(I2C/SPI/UART/FIFO)`

* Get the port it connected. If no other usb device is around, it should go to `/dev/ttyUSB0`, but run `dmesg | grep tty` to confirm, the print should look something like:

`[ 6416.940532] usb 1-2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0`

* Ensure you have access to usb port:

`sudo adduser USERNAME dialout`

* Finally:

`roslaunch robotiq_2f_hw_usb robotiq_2f_85_USB.launch usb_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 server_id:=9`

The arguments are not mandatory. The `usb_port` defaults to `/dev/ttyUSB0`. Not sure how to test this without the urcap scripts, but you need to figure out the server id of the gripper. It defaults to 9 because that's the id of the gripper this package was developed with, but this might change.
