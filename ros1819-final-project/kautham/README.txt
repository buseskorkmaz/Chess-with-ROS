The Kautham Project is a software tool used at the Institute of Industrial 
and Control Engineering (IOC-UPC) for teaching and research in robot motion 
planning. The tool allows to cope with problems with one or more robots, 
being a generic robot defined as a kinematic tree with a mobile base. i.e. 
the tool can plan and simulate from simple two degrees of freedom free-flying 
robots to multi-robot scenarios with mobile manipulators equipped with 
anthropomorphic hands. The main core of planners is provided by the Open 
Motion Planning Library (OMPL). Different basic planners can be flexibly 
used and parameterized, allowing students to gain insight into the different 
planning algorithms. Among the advanced features the tool allows to easily 
define the coupling between degrees of freedom, the dynamic simulation and
the integration with task planers. It is principally being used in the 
research of motion planning strategies for hand-arm robotic systems.
