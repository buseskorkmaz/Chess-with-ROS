Compiling Kautham
=================

The Kautham has been tested in GNU/Linux distributions (Ubuntu and Debian).
The needed dependencies are easily installable from any GNU/Linux distribution.

The current version of Kautham has not been tested in Windows and Mac OS/X. It
is possible to build it in both platforms, but it will be necessary to build some
of its dependencies (mainly Coin and SoQt). It is left as future work. 


Installing the dependencies
===========================


Debian Jessie
-------------

$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 63DE76AC0B6779BF

$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://sir.upc.edu/debian-robotics jessie-robotics main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-robotics.list'

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsoqt4-dev libcoin80-dev \
libassimp-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev \
libode-dev libfcl-dev libarmadillo-dev libpugixml-dev freeglut3-dev libompl-dev


Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS
-----------------------

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deb-rob/ros-xenial

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsoqt4-dev libcoin80-dev \
libassimp-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev \
libode-dev libfcl-dev libarmadillo-dev libpugixml-dev freeglut3-dev libompl-dev


Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 LTS                     
-----------------------

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deb-rob/ros-trusty

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsoqt4-dev libcoin80-dev \
libassimp-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev \
libode-dev libfcl-dev libarmadillo-dev libpugixml-dev freeglut3-dev libompl-dev



Building
========

From the folder of the obtained sources (tar.gz or cloned from a git repository):

$ mkdir build

$ cd build

In order to build it without documentation (doxygen generation) and without using ROS,
the next example is shown, where the installation path is set to '~/system':

$ cmake -DKAUTHAM_DOCUMENTATION=OFF -DKAUTHAM_ROS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/system ..

$ make

$ make install



Running Kautham
===============

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/system/lib

$ ~/system/bin/kautham-gui
